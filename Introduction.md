Sb3UGS is a tool for editing game files of Illusion games (--Supported games--). The latest titles use AssetBundle files, but Sb3UGS can also edit regular Unity game files of those games. It is limited to Unity versions used from those games.

On the left side are files, usually just shown in one window. For this screenshot I had dragged the Workspace of an imported FBX file below an opened AssetBundle file.
In the middle are editors of different kinds. I undocked one editor with the title "co_bot_00 [106]" which had been opened like the others in the middle.
On the far right hand side is the 3d preview for meshes, and images (the selector for that tab is covered in the screenshot).
At the bottom we have the Log window which shows warnings and errors of all kinds. Only few messages have their own dialog window - most are shown in the Log window. To the right of the Log window is the Script window. All changes in files have a command which could be used in scripts for automated processing.

Confusing fact of this gui is that each opened file has its own menu which includes a **File** menu. So you can see two File menus in the screenshot.

Note the status line at the very bottom. Sb3UGS lacks documentation, but has many tooltips integrated. The status line repeats the last shown tooltip. The tooltip shown there is longer visible.
